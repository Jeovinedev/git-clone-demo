DAILY -STOIC.
The Stoics knew that each of us was born inherently unique. 
Well before an understanding of the science of DNA,
they implicitly grasped that never before and never again will our combinations of genetics-
exist—that we are singular. 
And that one of the worst things a human being can do with this rarest of rarities is to give-
it up.To not be our singular selves.

The great Rainn Wilson was recently on the Daily Stoic podcast and told the story of a painful-
 period in which he tried to be someone he wasn’t.
 In 1995, Rainn got cast in his first Broadway play. In his head, he had this preconceived-
    notion of a Broadway actor: very professional, very serious, very matter-of-fact. 
    Rainn tried to be that person. “And guess what? I sucked,” he said. 
    Night after night, for the entirety of the six-month broadway run, “I sucked. 
    And it was a miserable six months. There’s nothing worse than knowing what you are doing-
is terrible…And when I finished the play, I said, Never again.
Never again am I going to do that. I’m going to find my authentic voice as an actor. 
I’m quirky, I’m kind of weird—I’m going to embrace that.
I’m not going to try to be something to please someone else. I gotta be me.
And I really just changed how I was as an actor at that point.”
